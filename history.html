	Early development
	</font>
	<p align="justify">
		Java was developed by James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton at Sun Microsystems, which was later acquired by Oracle Corporation. The project, initially called "Oak," began in 1991 and aimed to create a programming language for consumer electronics. The team shifted their focus to the emerging internet and the World Wide Web.

	Public introduction
	</font>
	<p align="justify">
		In May 1995, Sun Microsystems publicly announced Java at 
		the SunWorld conference. It gained attention for its "Write 
		Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) philosophy, meaning that Java 
		programs could run on any device or platform that had a 
		Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This was a significant 
		departure from other programming languages at the time.

	Official release
	</font>
	<p align="justify">
		The first official version of Java, Java 1.0, was released 
		in January 1996. It included a core set of features and 
		APIs that set the foundation for subsequent versions.
