		Java is a versatile, object-oriented, and widely-used programming language originally developed by James Gosling and Mike Sheridan at Sun Microsystems, which is now owned by Oracle Corporation. It was officially released in January 1996. Java is known for its platform independence, meaning that Java programs can run on any device or platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
